        <h2>ðŸ“™ The Silence (A Short Story) by Haruki Murakami</h2>
        <p>
            "The Silence" follows the protagonist&apos;s recollection of a past encounter with someone who left a lasting, albeit unpleasant, mark on his life. 
            The most striking moment in the story is the train sceneâ€”a silent stare-down between the two. In that moment, 
            the protagonist realizes just how pitiful the other person truly is. Outwardly, they seem accomplished, fulfilled. But beneath all their so-called glory, 
            they are nothing more than an empty slate.
            For context, the two have bad blood. Back in high school, this person falsely accused the protagonist of bullying a deceased classmate, making his final months of school unbearable. 
            I was 15 when I first read it, and to my growing mind, it was astounding how such a simple realization could hold so much weight.

        <h2>ðŸ“™ The Kite Runner (A Novel) by Khaled Hosseini</h2>
        <p>
            A deeply emotional tale of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set against the backdrop of a changing Afghanistan. 
            The story follows Amir, a privileged boy, and Hassan, his loyal friend and servant&apos;s son. 
            A single act of cowardice alters their fates forever, and years later, Amir is given a chance to make amendsâ€”but at a heavy cost. I read this at a time when I didnâ€™t fully grasp the weight of guilt and redemption, but even then, the story haunted me.
            After reading this, you'll never be the same. It feels like emerging from a warâ€”a war that breaks your heart, 
            shifts your perception, and transforms your very being. There&apos;s no going back to what you once were; the change is irreversible.

        <h2>ðŸ“™ Thousand Splendid Suns (A Novel) by Khaled Hosseini</h2>
        <p>
            A heartbreaking yet powerful story of two Afghan women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives intertwine under tragic circumstances. 
            Despite their suffering under war and an abusive husband, their bond becomes their greatest strength. 
            This novel isn&apos;t just about painâ€”it&apos;s about resilience, love, and survival. It made me realize just how much strength women can carry, even in the most hopeless of situations.
            This taught me about women&apos;s empowerment in the most haunting way. As a young reader, it opened my eyes to the universal truths 
            of womanhoodâ€”how, in the end, women only have each other.

        <h2>ðŸ“™ The Outsiders (A Novel) by S.E Hinton</h2>
        <p>
            A coming-of-age novel that follows Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser caught in a world where social class determines fate. 
            The rivalry between the Greasers and the Socs is intense, but when a tragedy strikes, Ponyboy is forced to see beyond labels and rethink 
            what it truly means to belong. Stay gold, Ponyboy. That line alone left a lasting impression on meâ€”one of those simple yet profound messages 
            that linger long after the last page.
            The circular plot is easily the most unforgettable detail of this story! 
            And of course, the Greek god look-a-like himselfâ€”Soda Pop. I remember reading this until the sun had set, crying my heart out the whole time. 
            It was just so, so sad.

        <h2>ðŸ“™ The Help (A Novel) by Kathryn Stockett</h2>
        <p>
            Set in 1960s Mississippi, The Help tells the story of three womenâ€”Skeeter, an aspiring writer; Aibileen, a wise Black maid; 
            and Minny, a strong-willed housekeeperâ€”who risk everything to expose the racial injustices experienced by Black maids working for white families. 
            Through humor, heartbreak, and courage, it sheds light on voices that were long silenced. This book reminded me how stories have the 
            power to challenge perspectives and rewrite history in their own way.
            This novel expanded my worldview in so many ways. The most striking detail for me was the irony of how white babies, 
            raised by Black women who became such significant figures in their infancy and childhood, would grow up to mirror their white parents' values, 
            despite the deep bond they shared with the women who cared for them.
