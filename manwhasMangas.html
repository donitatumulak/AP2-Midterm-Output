        <h2>üìì Semantic Error by jeosuri and angy</h2>
        <p>
            A battle of logic vs. chaos, wrapped in academia and sizzling tension. When a rigid, rule-abiding computer science major crosses paths with a free-spirited design student, 
            sparks fly‚Äîboth the frustrating and electrifying kind. What starts as a petty rivalry morphs into something deeper, proving that sometimes, 
            love is the ultimate "semantic error."
            I can&apos;t even begin to explain how much I adore this BL manhwa. At one point in my life, it was my lifesaver, 
            the most important thing to me. I absolutely love the playful banter and the subtle longing between the characters‚Äîit&apos;s everything.

        <h2>üìì Spirit Fingers by Han Kyung-Chal</h2>
        <p>
            A heartwarming and visually stunning coming-of-age story about self-discovery, friendship, and embracing one&apos;s quirks. 
            Amy, an insecure high school girl, stumbles into a club filled with eccentric artists who help her see herself in a whole new light. 
            This manhwa isn&apos;t just about art‚Äîit&apos;s about finding confidence in who you are, no matter how imperfect you feel.
            I read this when I was a struggling teen myself, and I absolutely love the female protagonist because a part of me resonates with her.
            Her feelings of alienation, extreme shyness, and longing for good company‚Äîthose emotions hit close to home.

        <img src = "old_fashioned_cupcake.jpg" alt = "Old-fashioned Cupcake book cover" width="250px" height="400px">
        <h2>üìì Old-fashioned Cupcake by sagansagan</h2>
        <p>
            A soft, bittersweet love story about aging, comfort, and unexpected romance. Nozue, a middle-aged office worker, 
            finds himself caught in the quiet, tender gaze of his younger colleague, Togawa. Between shared desserts and simple conversations, 
            the line between companionship and love begins to blur. It&apos;s a story that gently reminds you: it&apos;s never too late to fall in love.
            I adore the author&apos;s art style and the chosen theme for the story. It&apos;s such a great read, one you&apos;ll always reminisce about; 
            one you'd want forget just so you could read it again for the first time.
        </p>
        <img src = "yoake_no_uta.jpg" alt = "Yoake No Uta book cover" width="250px" height="400px">
        <h2>üìì Yoake No Uta/Lullaby of the Dawn by Ichika Yuno</h2>
        <p>
            Elva is cursed to remain in a stagnant, unchanging body, isolated from others as he protects the island. When Alto learns about him, 
            he vows to stay by his side and free him from his lonely duty. Over years, their bond deepens, and against all odds, Elva&apos;s body 
            begins to show signs of recovery. This manhwa touched me with its quiet yet powerful story of love, sacrifice, and healing.
            This is an ongoing story, but it&apos;s still such a beautiful read. What I love most is how the leads clearly have each other's backs‚Äîthey‚Äôre so undeniably 
            in love with each other you'd wish you'll experience it in real-life.

        <h2>üìì Heesoo in Class 2 by lily</h2>
        <p>
            Heesu&apos;s entire world revolves around his best friend (and secret crush), Chanyoung. He&apos;s totally fine just being ‚ÄúChanyoung‚Äôs friend,‚Äù 
            listening to all his girl problems and cheering him on from the sidelines. But one day, everything changes‚Äîpeople all over school start whispering his name. 
            Turns out, there&apos;s a rumor that if you have love troubles, Heesu in Class 2 is the guy to go to for advice! The only problem? 
            Heesu has zero clue how to deal with his own love life.
            I absolutely loved this story‚Äîit&apos;s heartfelt, awkwardly sweet, and so easy to relate to. 
            Watching Heesu navigate his feelings while dealing with unexpected attention made me feel all kinds of things!
