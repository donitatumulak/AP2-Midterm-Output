            <p>Welcome, fellow book addict! I hope you're ready to venture into this fiction-filled rabbit hole—
                because what&apos;s better for a reader than a never-ending spiral of literary obsession?</p>
            <p>It&apos;s the middle of the night. Silence fills the air, the moonlight gently pouring through your window as sleep evades you. 
                Debussy plays softly in your worn-out headphones, setting the mood. As an avid reader, you&apos;ve found yourself in that familiar, 
                restless place—the point where your TBR list feels uninspiring, and nothing seems to spark your interest. 
                Just when you thought you&apos;d have to settle for another dull night, you stumble upon a website. 
                A website made by a stranger (that&apos;s me), whose mission is to share her reading journey and the books that have made an impact. 
                Because, let&apos;s be honest, sharing books this personal feels a little shameful—but isn&apos;t there a beauty in letting the world in on your obsession?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this website, I&apos;ll be sharing—albeit reluctantly—some of my most unforgettable reading experiences across various categories. 
                From the local Wattpad stories that introduced me to the many flavors of love, to the mind-bending works of Haruki Murakami, 
                my personal favorite author—one so impactful he shaped my adolescence. From the heartbreaking realities of war in Afghanistan 
                to the stark truths of racial segregation in America. From two boys falling in love to a girl discovering her purpose in an unexpected place. 
                These are the stories that have stayed with me, and now, I&apos;m letting you in on them.
            </p>
            <p>From one stranger to another, let&apos;s dive into the world of fiction and indulge in our fixation.</p>

            <p>A little side note, friend—don&apos;t get your hopes up too much. My thoughts on each are brief and simple. 
                If I had more time, I&apos;d have given you something far more in-depth. But alas, it&apos;s midterm week, and I&apos;m racing against the clock. 
                So, here we are.
